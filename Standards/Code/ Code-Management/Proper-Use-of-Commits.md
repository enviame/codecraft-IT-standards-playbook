# Proper Use of Commits

## 1. Purpose
Best practices for writing commit messages and structuring commits.

### 1. Commit Structure

**Small and Focused Commits:** Each commit should represent a logical and complete change. Avoid large commits that mix multiple unrelated changes.

**Atomic Commits:** A commit should do one thing. If you need to make multiple changes, split them into multiple commits.

**Frequent Commits:** Commit frequently to maintain a clear and easy-to-follow history.

### 2. Commit Messages

**Commit Message Format:**
- **Summary Line (max 50 characters):** A brief description of the change.
- **Blank Line:** Separator between the summary and the body.
- **Body (max 72 characters per line):** Detailed explanation of the change, if necessary.

**Example Commit Message:**
