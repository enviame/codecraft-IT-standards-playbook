# Knowledge Repository

Welcome to the **Knowledge Repository**, a centralized and structured resource designed to provide developers with essential knowledge, examples, and guidance for various technical areas. This repository is tailored to be useful for developers of all levels, offering both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.

## Objective
The goal of this repository is to document and share non-sensitive, practical, and theoretical knowledge that can help developers enhance their understanding and skills. By maintaining a public repository, we aim to foster collaboration and provide easy access to resources that support learning and development.

## Repository Structure
The repository is divided into main categories, each representing a technical area. Each area contains multiple topics, and each topic follows a consistent structure:

### Main Categories
- **Development**: Contains topics related to software development, programming languages, frameworks, and best practices.
- **Google Cloud**: Focused on tools, services, and practices related to Google Cloud Platform.
- **Miscellaneous**: Covers additional areas such as Bash scripting, Docker, VSCode plugins, and more.
- **Blog post**

### Topic Structure
Each topic is organized as follows:

```
│── <Category Name>
│   │── <Title Topic>
│   │   │── Readme.md            // Theoretical explanation of the topic, abstracted from specific languages
│   │   │── <language1>/
│   │   │   │── repo-example/    // A complete functional example in the specified language
│   │   │   │── images/          // Images supporting the main Readme.md
│   │   │   │── Readme.md        // Language-specific documentation
│   │   │── <language2>/
│   │   │   │── repo-example/    // A complete functional example in another language
│   │   │   │── images/          // Images supporting the main Readme.md
│   │   │   │── Readme.md        // Language-specific documentation
│   │── Readme.md                // Overview for the category
```

### Key Components
1. **Readme Files**
   - Each topic includes a `Readme.md` that provides theoretical explanations in a generic, language-agnostic manner.
   - Language-specific folders also contain `Readme.md` files with implementation details.

2. **Repo-example**
   - Functional repositories with complete, runnable examples.
   - Examples may cover multiple programming languages where applicable.

3. **Images**
   - A dedicated `images` folder to store visuals supporting the documentation.

### Example
Here is an example of a topic structure under the **Development** category:

```
│── Development
│   │── Data Structures
│   │   │── Readme.md            // General overview of data structures
│   │   │── python/
│   │   │   │── repo-example/    // Python implementation of data structures
│   │   │   │── images/
│   │   │   │── Readme.md        // Python-specific explanation
│   │   │── java/
│   │   │   │── repo-example/    // Java implementation of data structures
│   │   │   │── images/
│   │   │   │── Readme.md        // Java-specific explanation
```
